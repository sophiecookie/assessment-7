Time to run code with unshift(): 28.2 μs


In general, as the array size grows from Tiny to Extra Large, the execution time of unshift() increases dramatically, while the push() method remains relatively stable. 
This sugggests that the 'unshift()' method does not scale well and 'push()' has a better scalability.

In JavaScript, the 'push()' method appends elements to the end of an array, while 'unshift()' inserts elements at the beginning.
The 'unshift()' method requires shifting all existing elements to make room for the new element at the beginning, the time complexity is O(n).
The 'push()' method adds elements to the end of the array, which has a time complexity of O(1).
Therefore, push method is more efficient.
